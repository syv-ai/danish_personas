## Setup

### Installation

1. Run `make install`, which sets up a virtual environment and all Python dependencies
   therein.
2. Run `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment.

### Adding and Removing Packages

To install new PyPI packages, run:

```bash
uv add <package-name>
```

To remove them again, run:

```bash
uv remove <package-name>
```

To show all installed packages, run:

```bash
uv pip list
```

## All Built-in Commands

The project includes the following convenience commands:

- `make install`: Install the project and its dependencies in a virtual environment.
- `make install-pre-commit`: Install pre-commit hooks for linting, formatting and type
  checking.
- `make check`: Lint and format the code using `ruff`, and type check using `ty`.
- `make test`: Run tests using `pytest` and update the coverage badge in the readme.
- `make docker`: Build a Docker image and run the Docker container.
- `make tree`: Show the project structure as a tree.

## A Word on Modules and Scripts

In the `src` directory there are two subdirectories, `danish_personas`
and `scripts`. This is a brief explanation of the differences between the two.

### Modules

All Python files in the `danish_personas` directory are _modules_
internal to the project package. Examples here could be a general data loading script, a
definition of a model, or a training function. Think of modules as all the building
blocks of a project.

When a module is importing functions/classes from other modules we use the _relative
import_ notation - here's an example:

```python
from .other_module import some_function
```

### Scripts

Python files in the `scripts` folder are scripts, which are short code snippets that are
_external_ to the project package, and which is meant to actually run the code. As such,
_only_ scripts will be called from the terminal. An analogy here is that the internal
`numpy` code are all modules, but the Python code you write where you import some
`numpy` functions and actually run them, that a script.

When importing module functions/classes when you're in a script, you do it like you
would normally import from any other package:

```python
from danish_personas import some_function
```

Note that this is also how we import functions/classes in tests, since each test Python
file is also a Python script, rather than a module.

## Features

### Docker Setup

A Dockerfile is included in the new repositories, which by default runs
`src/scripts/main.py`. You can build the Docker image and run the Docker container by
running `make docker`.

### Automatic Test Coverage Calculation

Run `make test` to test your code, which also updates the "coverage badge" in the
README, showing you how much of your code base that is currently being tested.

### Continuous Integration

Github CI pipelines are included in the repo, running all the tests in the `tests`
directory, as well as building online documentation, if Github Pages has been enabled
for the repository (can be enabled on Github in the repository settings).

### Code Spaces

Code Spaces is a new feature on Github, that allows you to develop on a project
completely in the cloud, without having to do any local setup at all. This repo comes
included with a configuration file for running code spaces on Github. When hosted on
`syv-ai/danish_personas` then simply press the
`<> Code` button and add a code space to get started, which will open a VSCode window
directly in your browser.
